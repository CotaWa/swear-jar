This discord bot was created for a server with me and my friends, so don't expect anything big.

To get started, clone the repo, then create four files named "data.json", "users.json", "swear_words.json" and your ".env" file for your discord bot token.

To add a swear word you can run "/add_word {word} {price}". To remove you run "/remove_word {word}". To edit the price of a word you run "/edit_word {word} {price}" where the word is the word you want to edit and price is the price you want to set it to.
There are more commands that you can check out by using "/swear_help" to get a list of available commands.

Before running, you may want to edit the "swear_jar_manager_role" variable to the correspondig ID for the role in your discord server. The role gives access to a couple more commands than other users, that may or may not be important.
